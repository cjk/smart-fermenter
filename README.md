Node-based temperatur and humidity controller

## What?
Eating fermented food is healthy and delicious. Best if you make it yourself, like in jars in a cabinet.
For best results, you need to maintain certain temperature and humidity levels. This software helps you maintaining that.

## How?
In my setup, I have a temp./humidity sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi 2 running Arch-ARM and NodeJS and this small server/controller.
It checks current temp./hum. levels and switches on/off a heating-device / humidifier when necessary.
